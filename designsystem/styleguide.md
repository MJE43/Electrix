## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors.
- Use semantic HTML elements to structure content properly.
- Provide alternative text for images and icons.
- Ensure interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

## Responsive Design

- Design should be mobile-first and adapt smoothly to larger screen sizes.
- Use Tailwind's responsive utility classes for consistent breakpoints across the project.

## Components

(List and describe any custom components or common UI patterns specific to your project here.)

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `header-component.tsx`, `about-page.tsx`).
- React components should be in PascalCase (e.g., `HeaderComponent.tsx`).

## Code Style

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for general JavaScript/TypeScript conventions.
- Use functional components and hooks in React.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for better refactoring and intellisense support.

Remember to keep this style guide updated as the project evolves.
